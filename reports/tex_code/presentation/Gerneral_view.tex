    \begin{itemize}
     \item<1-> In this project, we compared the growth of commodity prices, the stock indices, and the inflation rate.
     \item<2-> It is quite evident that commodities grow faster than inflation and are more volatile.

     \item<3> Further, we notice a steady growth in HICP, while commodities experience also periods of extended drawdown. This means that depending on the period chosen, we could actually see inflation growing faster than commodities. 
     \item<3> Nevertheless, in the long term, commodity prices grow faster.
